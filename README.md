# SWIFT DROP PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
## INTRODUCTION
This is an EXCEL project that provides insight into the Dashboard of Swift Drop Express Performance Analysis. 
The Dashboard provides actionable insight into the performance analysis of Swift Drop Express for the month of September 2023. focusing on key metrics such as Order status, Delivery ID, Vehicle Information, Current location, Delivery time, 
Delays, Customer Feedback, Route, Delivery Zone, Allocation Rules, Time Stamp for tracking.

The goal of the project is to provide insight in the dash board of Swift Drop Express Performance Analysis and then provide Data driven decisions that will improve the operations and Performance of Services rendered in Swift Drop Express delivery.

## DATA SOURCE
-	The Data set used in this project was gotten from a Data community named “DATA CONNECT”
-	The Data was stored in a CSV file.

## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED FOR THIS PROJECT
-	 Data cleaning
-	 Data visualization
-	 Critical Thinking
-	 Problem Solving
-	 Data reporting

## DATA TRANSFORMATION/ CLEANING
I cleaned and transformed the messy data n Microsoft EXCEL 

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
EDA involved exploring the operational dynamics of Swift Drop Express delivery services to answer key questions such as


•	What is the average delivery time across different zones

•	Which zone experiences the most frequent delays

•	Which drivers are consistently delivering on time


•	Are there specific vehicle types associated with longer delivery time


•	What is the overall customer sentiment from feedback

•	Are patterns between delays and negative feedback


•	Are there any routes with recurring delays

## ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
I created a very simple and easy to understand visuals using 3 colors (blue, black and grey) to show different insights gotten from the data set. 
The color used for this visual are bold, eye-catching and can be understood by anyone, even those with eye defect 

I created a number of visuals to show the Total patients, Avg wait time, Avg patient age, Avg satisfaction score by wait time category, total patients by age groups, total patients by patients’ race. Etc.

### The Dashboard comprises of these visuals:

Total order Sent out in the month of September 2023 are 1500 orders.
